It's a combination of headaches and a throbbing pain in my eye that is so severe it's affecting my daily life.

It's not just the discomfort that's bothering me, but I've also had hoarseness in my voice for a couple of months now, and I've noticed that I've been coughing more than usual, especially first thing in the morning, which I'm convinced is related to the acid reflux I'm sure I've been experiencing, but I'm worried it might be something more serious."

My strength is low, and I'm constantly sleepy with sweating despite high temperatures. I had episodes of headache, vomiting, and heavy sweating as well.

845,Dengue,"Doc, I've been feeling utterly exhausted for weeks, with on-and-off fever that spikes to 103Â°F at night, accompanied by a throbbing headache that's been making my eyes ache, and lately, I've noticed painful joint and muscle aches that make it hard for me to even move my arms and legs. Over the past few days, I've also had this excruciating rash on my legs and arms that's been getting worse, and my appetite has vanished - I just feel so drained and weak all the time."

2104,Jaundice,"Over the past week, I've noticed that my skin and eyes have taken on a yellowish hue, which I initially thought was just a side effect of the new medications I've been prescribed.

Sometimes, I even feel like I've gotta pee all the time, but not a lot comes out, and when it does, it's like a weak trickle. Oh, and I'm pretty sure it started after that lovely vacation to the Dominican Republic when I did some camel wrestling (don't ask), and I got my first UTI ever. Could it have triggered something? And one more thing, doc, I've got this creepy, tingling feeling in my lower abdomen that's been going on for a few months, it's hard to describe... almost like my skin's crawling when the cramps kick in."
