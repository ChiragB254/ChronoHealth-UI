It's a combination of headaches and a throbbing pain in my eye that is so severe it's affecting my daily life. At times, my eyes feel like they're under constant pressure, which worsens in the evening. The sensations have made it difficult to concentrate and have persisted despite various treatments. I'm concerned this may be related to chronic migraines or sinus issues."

19,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"I've been experiencing this burning sensation in my chest for the past few nights, every time I lie down after eating a large meal, which gets worse if I eat spicy foods or drink too much coffee. It's not just the discomfort that's bothering me, but I've also had hoarseness in my voice for a couple of months now, and I've noticed that I've been coughing more than usual, especially first thing in the morning, which I'm convinced is related to the acid reflux I'm sure I've been experiencing, but I'm worried it might be something more serious."

My strength is low, and I'm constantly sleepy with sweating despite high temperatures. I had episodes of headache, vomiting, and heavy sweating as well.

33,Acne,"Doctor, I've been dealing with this for months now - small, red bumps have been popping up on my chest and back, but recently, they've started to get bigger and more painful, with pus-filled cysts that feel like hot, throbbing lumps under the skin.

845,Dengue,"Doc, I've been feeling utterly exhausted for weeks, with on-and-off fever that spikes to 103°F at night, accompanied by a throbbing headache that's been making my eyes ache, and lately, I've noticed painful joint and muscle aches that make it hard for me to even move my arms and legs.

2104,Jaundice,"Over the past week, I've noticed that my skin and eyes have taken on a yellowish hue, which I initially thought was just a side effect of the new medications I've been prescribed.

Sometimes, I even feel like I've gotta pee all the time, but not a lot comes out, and when it does, it's like a weak trickle. Oh, and I'm pretty sure it started after that lovely vacation to the Dominican Republic when I did some camel wrestling (don't ask), and I got my first UTI ever. Could it have triggered something?
